This is my first game made with [Ebiten](https://github.com/hajimehoshi/ebiten) - a nice simple engine which allows you to write games in Go. Also this is the first game I've made public.

Don't expect much from it - it's as simple as it can be, so that the source code remains simple and understandable.

# Building and running

```sh
go run .
```

# There's more...

An article about my experiences with Ebiten and how this game works are coming soon to [my blog](https://eliasdaler.github.io/)!
